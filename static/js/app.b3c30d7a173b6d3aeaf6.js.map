/>&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p><strong>家庭系统排列到底是什么？</strong></p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>&ldquo;家庭系统排列&rdquo; 是德国心理治疗大师伯特&middot;海灵格经30年的研究发展起来的一个新的家庭治疗方法。通过现象学探究问题的引发根源，呈现隐藏在现实背后的影响因素。在当今的欧美广泛地应用于康复、教育、商业、组织发展（如企业重组、企业并购、企业文化改变）等方面，在心理治疗方面则多应用于家庭治疗。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>家庭系统排列最早是从家庭治疗开始，但是发展到今天已经远远超越了这个领域，已经从人与家庭系统的关系，发展到人与自然、人与宇宙的关系&hellip;&hellip;</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\"

/>&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p><strong>家庭系统排列的原理</strong></p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>作为社会性的生命，每个人都隶属于某些系统：他会是一个家庭的成员、某个社区的居民、某个组织的一员&hellip;&hellip;而且他本人就是一个系统，一个身、心各要素构成的系统。这些大大小小的系统相互联系，结构成一个完整的社会系统。社会中的每个人就是在这样一个社会系统中孕育、出生、成长起来的。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>从人的发展来说，家庭是基本，且重要的一个系统。海灵格发现在家庭系统中，有一些隐藏的、不易被人们意识觉察到的动力操控着家庭成员之间的关系&mdash;&mdash;爱的序位，并不跟随社会及文化的标准或规则运行，而是在这些标准或规则之上运行。如果我们跟随&ldquo;爱的序位&rdquo;和家人相处，关系就会很好，大家都能够快乐和健康的成长；如果我们忽略了它，家人会受困扰，这些困扰就是&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>海灵格发现，很多人的身心问题，其实都是&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;造成的。&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;可以说是&ldquo;重复着一个之前的家族成员的命运&rdquo;。而很多&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;的开始，是儿童早期凭着对父母单纯的&ldquo;爱&rdquo;，企图接过父母的问题引起的。用当今精神分析理念来说，是一个人没有顺利完成与父母的分离造成的。在一个家庭中，这种未完成的分离还可能是家族中一连串的&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;关系。&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;会使一个家庭成员从幼年开始就产生不能理解的思想、情绪、行为以及人际关系欠佳、疾病和心理问题，并延续在其生命中。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>这些隐藏的动力影响或控制着我们，而我们又难以觉察到它的存在，但我们可能实实在在地因没有尊重它而感受到伤害。因此，我们可以从这些伤害中知晓它的存在。海灵格的&ldquo;家庭系统排列&rdquo;治疗，就是借由他所发展出来的方法，将&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;的原因显露出来，而且往往能找出化解的可能。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>系统排列是新发展出来的应用学问，它隶属于现象学，是通过个案代表的方式呈现出来我们当下的状态，进而能够帮助人去取得系统里隐藏的资料，因而对事情的处理有更清晰的了解。系统排列的技巧，用在企业管理、人事纠纷、未来选择等需要中，称为&ldquo;组织系统排列&rdquo;；用在心理治疗方面，则能够把一些深层的家族 困扰找出和化解，称为&ldquo;家庭系统排列&rdquo;。</p>↵</body>↵</html>',\n      num_read: 121,\n      keyword: [\"大大\", \"关键\", \"小康\", \"会议\"],\n      relevant_articles: [{ id: 1, title: \"孩子不吃饭怎么办？灌药\" }, { id: 2,

'小宇是我手上的一个新生，才来一个星期的时间，他高高壮壮，咋一看上去与他初三的身份实在不符，联想到我之前带过的一个学生，他们体型相似，所以我本以为这个小伙子也是很健谈，也是很自信的，但是与他简单交流过后，才发现，这是个害羞的男孩儿，细声细语，也不太敢正视我的眼睛，生怕惊扰了这一片宁静。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵与小宇接触多了之后，他渐渐打开了自己，笑容没那么羞涩了，开始和我聊他最喜欢的汽车，聊他精通的计算机，聊他们班上的同学和老师，也问我很多问题，这个在两个培优老师看来很聪明的学生，逐渐在展示着他的优势。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵↵↵&nbsp;↵↵小宇家住黄陂，就读黄陂实验中学，周末两天的时间都在尖锋，妈妈希望小宇在这里的时间，将学校作业和培优作业全部完成，并再安排其它的内容，用一句话说，就是不要让他闲着。小宇来的第一天，午饭是我们带他出去的，第二天，小宇说自己可以单独出去。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵这些在我们看来，并没有什么不妥，因为这已经是一个初三的大男孩了，很多事情他可以自己安排。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵后来妈妈说，小宇在小学的时候从楼上摔下来过，所以在安全问题上他们很注意，希望避免一切危险发生，不要让他单独出去，更别谈独自做什么事情，就连每天放学后的时间，也是妈妈全权安排的，家长完全将小宇的生活和学习与外界隔离了，他们以为这样是给他最好的保护，殊不知这样的过度照顾，使得小宇基本没有自己的想法和处事的能力，在父母的特殊羽翼下，就算小宇心底想反抗，但也只是想想而已。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵↵↵&nbsp;↵↵写到这里，我不得不将小宇和我另外一个学生作个对比。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵他是一个新初一的学生，瘦瘦小小，但是人小鬼大，家长将学生作为一个个体，而不是附属品，只要是学生能做的，都尽量让他自己去处理，在小学阶段，他可以一个人坐轻轨坐地铁去爷爷家，一个人逛公园，一个人去万达吃饭看电影。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵他是一个新初三的学生，高高壮壮，但是很害羞，家长将学生作为一个没有自主生活能力的人来看待，生怕他一个人会受骗，会受伤，只要可以，什么都替学生做了。这种表面上的过度保护，实际上掩盖的是对孩子权利的剥夺。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵小宇来的时间不长，还有更多需要我去了解，虽然现在有问题出现了，但是我一点都不害怕，我相信，我所学习到的知识，一定会影响到小宇，影响到小宇的家庭。',\n

/>&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p><strong>家庭系统排列到底是什么？</strong></p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>&ldquo;家庭系统排列&rdquo; 是德国心理治疗大师伯特&middot;海灵格经30年的研究发展起来的一个新的家庭治疗方法。通过现象学探究问题的引发根源，呈现隐藏在现实背后的影响因素。在当今的欧美广泛地应用于康复、教育、商业、组织发展（如企业重组、企业并购、企业文化改变）等方面，在心理治疗方面则多应用于家庭治疗。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>家庭系统排列最早是从家庭治疗开始，但是发展到今天已经远远超越了这个领域，已经从人与家庭系统的关系，发展到人与自然、人与宇宙的关系&hellip;&hellip;</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://image.taoerxue.com/999b7dc51f4c471a8a9fddafbf51a399.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 326px;\" /></p>↵↵<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p><strong>家庭系统排列的原理</strong></p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>作为社会性的生命，每个人都隶属于某些系统：他会是一个家庭的成员、某个社区的居民、某个组织的一员&hellip;&hellip;而且他本人就是一个系统，一个身、心各要素构成的系统。这些大大小小的系统相互联系，结构成一个完整的社会系统。社会中的每个人就是在这样一个社会系统中孕育、出生、成长起来的。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>从人的发展来说，家庭是基本，且重要的一个系统。海灵格发现在家庭系统中，有一些隐藏的、不易被人们意识觉察到的动力操控着家庭成员之间的关系&mdash;&mdash;爱的序位，并不跟随社会及文化的标准或规则运行，而是在这些标准或规则之上运行。如果我们跟随&ldquo;爱的序位&rdquo;和家人相处，关系就会很好，大家都能够快乐和健康的成长；如果我们忽略了它，家人会受困扰，这些困扰就是&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>海灵格发现，很多人的身心问题，其实都是&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;造成的。&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;可以说是&ldquo;重复着一个之前的家族成员的命运&rdquo;。而很多&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;的开始，是儿童早期凭着对父母单纯的&ldquo;爱&rdquo;，企图接过父母的问题引起的。用当今精神分析理念来说，是一个人没有顺利完成与父母的分离造成的。在一个家庭中，这种未完成的分离还可能是家族中一连串的&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;关系。&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;会使一个家庭成员从幼年开始就产生不能理解的思想、情绪、行为以及人际关系欠佳、疾病和心理问题，并延续在其生命中。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>这些隐藏的动力影响或控制着我们，而我们又难以觉察到它的存在，但我们可能实实在在地因没有尊重它而感受到伤害。因此，我们可以从这些伤害中知晓它的存在。海灵格的&ldquo;家庭系统排列&rdquo;治疗，就是借由他所发展出来的方法，将&ldquo;牵连&rdquo;的原因显露出来，而且往往能找出化解的可能。</p>↵↵<p><br />&nbsp;</p>↵↵<p>系统排列是新发展出来的应用学问，它隶属于现象学，是通过个案代表的方式呈现出来我们当下的状态，进而能够帮助人去取得系统里隐藏的资料，因而对事情的处理有更清晰的了解。系统排列的技巧，用在企业管理、人事纠纷、未来选择等需要中，称为&ldquo;组织系统排列&rdquo;；用在心理治疗方面，则能够把一些深层的家族 困扰找出和化解，称为&ldquo;家庭系统排列&rdquo;。</p>↵</body>↵</html>',\n          num_read: 121,\n          keyword: [\"大大\", \"关键\", \"小康\", \"会议\"],\n          relevant_articles: [\n            {id: 1, title:

'小宇是我手上的一个新生，才来一个星期的时间，他高高壮壮，咋一看上去与他初三的身份实在不符，联想到我之前带过的一个学生，他们体型相似，所以我本以为这个小伙子也是很健谈，也是很自信的，但是与他简单交流过后，才发现，这是个害羞的男孩儿，细声细语，也不太敢正视我的眼睛，生怕惊扰了这一片宁静。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵与小宇接触多了之后，他渐渐打开了自己，笑容没那么羞涩了，开始和我聊他最喜欢的汽车，聊他精通的计算机，聊他们班上的同学和老师，也问我很多问题，这个在两个培优老师看来很聪明的学生，逐渐在展示着他的优势。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵↵↵&nbsp;↵↵小宇家住黄陂，就读黄陂实验中学，周末两天的时间都在尖锋，妈妈希望小宇在这里的时间，将学校作业和培优作业全部完成，并再安排其它的内容，用一句话说，就是不要让他闲着。小宇来的第一天，午饭是我们带他出去的，第二天，小宇说自己可以单独出去。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵这些在我们看来，并没有什么不妥，因为这已经是一个初三的大男孩了，很多事情他可以自己安排。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵后来妈妈说，小宇在小学的时候从楼上摔下来过，所以在安全问题上他们很注意，希望避免一切危险发生，不要让他单独出去，更别谈独自做什么事情，就连每天放学后的时间，也是妈妈全权安排的，家长完全将小宇的生活和学习与外界隔离了，他们以为这样是给他最好的保护，殊不知这样的过度照顾，使得小宇基本没有自己的想法和处事的能力，在父母的特殊羽翼下，就算小宇心底想反抗，但也只是想想而已。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵↵↵&nbsp;↵↵写到这里，我不得不将小宇和我另外一个学生作个对比。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵他是一个新初一的学生，瘦瘦小小，但是人小鬼大，家长将学生作为一个个体，而不是附属品，只要是学生能做的，都尽量让他自己去处理，在小学阶段，他可以一个人坐轻轨坐地铁去爷爷家，一个人逛公园，一个人去万达吃饭看电影。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵他是一个新初三的学生，高高壮壮，但是很害羞，家长将学生作为一个没有自主生活能力的人来看待，生怕他一个人会受骗，会受伤，只要可以，什么都替学生做了。这种表面上的过度保护，实际上掩盖的是对孩子权利的剥夺。↵↵&nbsp;↵↵小宇来的时间不长，还有更多需要我去了解，虽然现在有问题出现了，但是我一点都不害怕，我相信，我所学习到的知识，一定会影响到小宇，影响到小宇的家庭。',\n
